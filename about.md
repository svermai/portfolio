## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I'm a **Bioinformatics Scientist** with over 4 years of experience in computational genomics, NGS pipeline development, and translational bioinformatics. I specialize in designing and automating workflows for large-scale genomics and clinical datasets using **Nextflow**, **Docker**, and **AWS**.

### 🔬 Current Focus Areas
- **Infectious Disease Genomics** – Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis for outbreak tracking and pathogen surveillance  
- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Surveillance** – Detecting and characterizing resistance genes from clinical isolates  
- **Metagenomics** – Environmental and clinical microbiome profiling using 16S and shotgun sequencing  
- **Microbiome Analytics** – Statistical and machine learning approaches to uncover host–microbiome interactions

I'm currently based in **Dubai**, working at the intersection of **bioinformatics**, **precision medicine**, and **public health genomics**.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

- **Languages**: Python, R, Bash, SQL  
- **NGS Tools**: FastQC, BWA, STAR, GATK, DESeq2, Qiime2, Seurat, Samtools  
- **Pipelines**: Nextflow, Docker, Snakemake  
- **Cloud & Compute**: AWS (Batch, S3, EC2), HPC, Git  
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, scikit-learn, Random Forest (applied to 16S and genomic data)  
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Plotly, ggplot2, RMarkdown
