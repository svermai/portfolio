## 👨‍💻 About Me

With 5+ years of experience in computational genomics, I specialize in developing scalable bioinformatics pipelines for **large-scale NGS data analysis**, translational research, and **public health genomics**. My work integrates **high-throughput sequencing**, **cloud computing**, and **machine learning** to advance infectious disease surveillance, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, and microbiome analytics.

## 🔬 Current Focus Areas

- **Infectious Disease Genomics** – Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis for outbreak tracking and pathogen surveillance  
- **Pathogen Genomics**: Bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for outbreak tracking, phylogenomics, and AMR gene prediction (CARD, ResFinder, AMRFinder).
- **Metagenomics**: Taxonomic and functional profiling of microbiomes (16S rRNA, shotgun sequencing) using Kraken2, MetaPhlAn, HUMAnN3, and MetaWRAP.
- **Microbiome Analytics**: Machine learning-driven insights into host–microbiome interactions.
- **Genome Assembly & Annotation**: Hybrid (short + long-read) assembly with Unicycler, Flye, SPAdes, and annotation via Prokka, Bakta.

Currently based in **Dubai**, I work at the intersection of **bioinformatics**, **precision medicine**, and **public health**, leveraging computational tools to enhance pathogen surveillance and genomic medicine
